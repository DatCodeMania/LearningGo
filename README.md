# LearningGo

## Disclaimer
Unless you are a Go beginner, you will probably not find much usage out of this repo!

## Explanation
I am currently reading the [Go Programming Language Book (it's free!)](https://www.gopl.io/), and will be committing my results to the book exercises as I go!.
This repository is mostly to hold myself accountable, see progress, and review things that I may have forgotten.
